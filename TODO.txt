                        - In processing an LUSERS message, the server
                          sends a set of replies from RPL_LUSERCLIENT,
                          RPL_LUSEROP, RPL_USERUNKNOWN,
                          RPL_LUSERCHANNELS and RPL_LUSERME.  When
                          replying, a server must send back
                          RPL_LUSERCLIENT and RPL_LUSERME.  The other
                          replies are only sent back if a non-zero count
                          is found for them.

                - When responding to the MOTD message and the MOTD file
                  is found, the file is displayed line by line, with
                  each line no longer than 80 characters, using
                  RPL_MOTD format replies.  These should be surrounded
                  by a RPL_MOTDSTART (before the RPL_MOTDs) and an
                  RPL_ENDOFMOTD (after).
